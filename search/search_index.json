These are resuable and  event-driven scripts  that act like application blueprintsand  handles tasks such as installation, scaling, monitoring, and integration with other charms. By using charms, users can standardize the deployment process.It helps to  reduce repetitive scripting work, and ensure best practices are followed every time an application is deployed. Juju also maintains a public Charm Store where users can find community-contributed and officially maintained charms for a wide range of applications and services.This allows  teams to focus more on business logic and less on infrastructure setup.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cloud Agnostic: Works across multiple cloud providers like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, OpenStack, and even bare metal.One of Juju\u2019s greatest strengths is its cloud-agnostic design. It provides a  framework for deploying applications across public clouds like AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure, as well as private clouds such as OpenStack, or even on bare metal servers using MAAS (Metal as a Service) or local containers with LXD. This flexibility enables organizations to  adopt hybrid or multi-cloud strategies with ease. Whether you're operating in a development, staging, or production environment, Juju allows you to replicate and manage your application models consistently across all platforms, thereby streamlining DevOps workflows and increasing deployment portability.</p> </li> <li> <p>GUI and CLI Support: Manage environments via command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical web-based GUI. Juju offers both a feature-rich Command-Line Interface (CLI) and an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI), fulfills  the needs of both technical users and those who prefer visual tools. The CLI is ideal for scripting, automation, and advanced configurations, giving users complete control over deployments and operations. On the other hand, the GUI provides a visual modeling environment where users can drag and drop services, define relationships, and monitor the status of their applications in real time. This dual-interface approach enhances user experience by offering flexibility in how environments are managed, monitored, and scaled.It makes  making Juju accessible to both beginners and experienced DevOps professionals.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"cli-reference/","title":"Juju CLI Reference","text":"<p>This guide provides an overview of essential Juju CLI (Command-Line Interface) commands.

Naming the controller helps you identify it, especially if one  manages multiple controllers.</p> <p>** Example</p> <p>Suppose you want to bootstrap Juju on the public cloud called aws and name your controller my-controller.Then</p> <pre><code>juju bootstrap aws my-controller\n</code></pre> <p>Juju will start provisioning resources on AWS.</p> <p>You will see output showing the bootstrap process, including creating instances and setting up the controller.</p> <p>Once complete, you get a success message like:</p> <p>Bootstrap Successful</p> <p>Controller \"my-controller\" bootstrapped on cloud \"aws\"</p> <p>After bootstrapping, you can start deploying applications with Juju using this controller.</p>"},{"location":"cli-reference/#add-a-model","title":"Add a Model","text":"<p>After bootstrapping a controller in Juju, the next step is to add a model.
