# Welcome to Juju & JAAS Documentation

# What is Juju?

**Juju** is an open-source **application modeling tool** developed by **Canonical**.It helps you **deploy, configure, scale, and manage** cloud-based applications and services efficiently.

 Key Features of Juju

- **Model-Driven Architecture**:  Juju helps users to define your application setup and relationships using models.Instead of manually configuring infrastructure and services,users can define high-level models that describe the desired state of their application  and it describes the  relationships between different components

- **Reusable Charms**:Charms are the core building blocks in Juju,including all the operational knowledge required to deploy, configure, and manage a specific application or service. These are resuable and  event-driven scripts  that act like application blueprintsand  handles tasks such as installation, scaling, monitoring, and integration with other charms. By using charms, users can standardize the deployment process.It helps to  reduce repetitive scripting work, and ensure best practices are followed every time an application is deployed. Juju also maintains a public Charm Store where users can find community-contributed and officially maintained charms for a wide range of applications and services.This allows  teams to focus more on business logic and less on infrastructure setup.

- **Cloud Agnostic**: Works across multiple cloud providers like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, OpenStack, and even bare metal.One of Jujuâ€™s greatest strengths is its cloud-agnostic design. It provides a  framework for deploying applications across public clouds like AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure, as well as private clouds such as OpenStack, or even on bare metal servers using MAAS (Metal as a Service) or local containers with LXD. This flexibility enables organizations to  adopt hybrid or multi-cloud strategies with ease. Whether you're operating in a development, staging, or production environment, Juju allows you to replicate and manage your application models consistently across all platforms, thereby streamlining DevOps workflows and increasing deployment portability.

- **GUI and CLI Support**: Manage environments via command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical web-based GUI.
Juju offers both a feature-rich Command-Line Interface (CLI) and an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI), fulfills  the needs of both technical users and those who prefer visual tools. The CLI is ideal for scripting, automation, and advanced configurations, giving users complete control over deployments and operations. On the other hand, the GUI provides a visual modeling environment where users can drag and drop services, define relationships, and monitor the status of their applications in real time. This dual-interface approach enhances user experience by offering flexibility in how environments are managed, monitored, and scaled.It makes  making Juju accessible to both beginners and experienced DevOps professionals.
